      dropdownContent: >-
        When you book a private charter with Sailing in Paradise you can expect
        a quality of service from years of experience in the industry but most
        of all your can expect a fun day (or evening) on the water that your
        group will love. Every day is different when you have your Gold Coast
        birthday party on board Sailing In Paradise but one thing is for sure...
        you're in for one hell of a good time.


        Some things we love include:


        Sailing, beach stopovers, beach volleyball, inflatables, stand up paddleboards, sunbathing, sunsets and dolphins. All included free of charge*.


        Some things are almost mandatory:


        Singing Happy Birthday to you, cake, embarrassing speeches, presents, cake, all your favourite songs...did we mention cake?


        As much as we have tried to bribe the dolphins to turn up every cruise we can't guarantee they will...fish to chase, waves to jump, fun to be had etc... but it sure is a beautiful sight when they do join us.

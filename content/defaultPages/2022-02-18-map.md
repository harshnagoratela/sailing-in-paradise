  ### GETTING TO THE MARINA


  We are conveniently located at Marina Mirage and Mariners Cove at 74 Seaworld Drive, Main Beach. The marinas are directly adjacent to one another and there is plentiful free parking which you are invited to use.


  ### HOW TO FIND THE BOATS AT THE MARINAS


  The access to the main marina jetty is at the very end (north western corner) of the carpark behind the 'Ridong Plaza' building.   Please take the jetty with the big yellow archway at Mariner's Cove. For the 'Oceans' please take the first arm (to your left) after going under the yellow archway - the boat should be visible straight away. For 'Spirit of Gwonda' and 'Seawind 1000XL' please take the second arm (to your left). The vessels are located half way down.     Please find a map below of the current vessel locations.  


  If you canâ€™t find us you can always call us and we will be happy to guide you.

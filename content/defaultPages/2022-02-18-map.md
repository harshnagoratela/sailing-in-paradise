  ### GETTING TO THE MARINA


  We are conveniently located at Marina Mirage and Mariners Cove at 74 Seaworld Drive, Main Beach. The marinas are directly adjacent to one another and there is plentiful free parking which you are invited to use.


  ### HOW TO FIND THE BOATS AT THE MARINAS


  The access to the main marina jetty is at the very end (north western corner) of the Mariner's Cove carpark.   Please take the jetty with the big yellow archway at Mariner's Cove. Our vessels are located on the first arm (to your left) after going under the first yellow archway, the boats are visible straight away. Please find a map below of the current vessel locations.  


  If you canâ€™t find us you can always call us and we will be happy to guide you.

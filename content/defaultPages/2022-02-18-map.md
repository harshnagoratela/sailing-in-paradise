  ### GETTING TO THE MARINA


  We are conveniently located at Marina Mirage at 74 Seaworld Drive, Main Beach. The marinas are directly adjacent to one another and there is plentiful free parking which you are invited to use.


  ### HOW TO FIND THE BOATS AT THE MARINAS


  Please take the jetty with the big yellow archway at Mariner's Cove. For the 'Seawind 1000XL' please take the first arm (to your left) after going under the yellow archway. For 'Spirit of Gwonda' and 'Oceans' please take the second arm (to your left). You should be able to see our boats from the start of the main jetty.    Please find a map below.  


  If you canâ€™t find us you can always call us and we will be happy to guide you.

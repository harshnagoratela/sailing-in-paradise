  ### GETTING TO THE MARINA


  We are conveniently located at Marina Mirage at 74 Seaworld Drive, Main Beach. The marinas are directly adjacent to one another and there is plentiful free parking which you are invited to use.


  ### HOW TO FIND THE BOATS AT THE MARINAS


  For 'Spirit of Gwonda', 'Oceans' and the 'Seawind 1000XL' - Please take the jetty with the big yellow archway at Mariner's Cove. Take the first arm (to your left) after going under the yellow archway.  You should be able to see our boat from the start of the main jetty.    Please find a map below.  


  If you canâ€™t find us you can always call us and we will be happy to guide you.

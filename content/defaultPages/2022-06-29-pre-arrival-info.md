  ### WELCOME TO SAILING IN PARADISE!


  Your charter is just around the corner and we look forward to welcoming you and your guests onboard :) We have put together some essential pre-charter info to help get you ready for a totally stress-free and seamless experience! 


  ###### GETTING TO THE MARINA


  We are conveniently located at Marina Mirage and Mariners Cove at 74 Seaworld Drive, Main Beach. The marinas are directly adjacent to one another and there is plentiful free parking which you are invited to use.


  ###### HOW TO FIND THE BOATS AT THE MARINAS


  The access to the main marina jetty is at the very end (north western corner) of the carpark behind the 'Ridong Plaza' building.   Please take the jetty with the big yellow archway at Mariner's Cove. For the 'Seawind 1000XL' please take the first arm (to your left) after going under the yellow archway. For 'Spirit of Gwonda' and 'Oceans' please take the second arm (to your left). You should be able to see our boats from the main jetty.    Please find a map below.  


  If you can’t find us you can always call us and we will be happy to guide you.

  ###### BOARDING INFO


  \- **Boarding is 10 mins prior** to your scheduled departure time. If you arrive early we ask that you please meet your group at the top, main boardwalk and wait there until our crew are ready for you as we may still be cleaning/preparing for your group. The Marinas are very narrow, so it can be unsafe for large groups to congregate near the boats. 


  \- Please bring any food, drinks, decorations etc with you on arrival.   On most occasions we are unfortunately unable to accept early deliveries due to the vessel's schedule and lack of storage space.


  ###### WHAT TO BRING


  \- Filtered water is available on board the vessels.  We suggest bringing a reusable water bottle.  


  \- For BYO guests, bottled drinks such as champagne, cruisers, beers etc are welcome. **Red wine and straight bottles of spirits are not permitted**, but you are welcome to bring along commercial pre-mixed spirits/RTDs.  Please BYO non-breakable cup if required.  We will provide eskies with ice for your use.


  \- We welcome any attire on board the vessels so please dress however you feel comfortable to suit the theme of your charter, whether than be a T-Shirt and shorts or cocktail attire.  On winter evenings a jacket is advisable. 


  \- No shoes, no worries!  We offer a relaxed, barefoot sailing experience for your safety and comfort on board.     **You will be asked to slip your shoes off prior to boarding and leave your worries at the dock.**   


  \- If you are sailing during the day and are planning to go for a swim or enjoy our complimentary beach activities, be sure to remember your beach towel, swimmers and sunscreen (slip, slop, slap!) 


  \- A friendly reminder that there is **no smoking** permitted onboard our vessels. Our crew can organise a smoking stop for any guests on request, please let them know at the start of your charter. 


  If you still have any unanswered questions or are unsure of something, please feel free to give us a call on 0438 915 222 or drop us an email at info@sailinginparadise.com.au.   


  We can't wait to welcome you on board.   


  See you soon!  :-)

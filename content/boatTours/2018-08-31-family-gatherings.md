  ## gold coast Family yacht charters


  There is something about the appeal of a day on the water that spans
  generations.  When you charter a boat with Sailing in Paradise we aim to
  provide a special experience the whole family will enjoy.    Loved by the
  grandparents just as much as the kids (and everybody in between) our 2
  beautiful sailing catamarans are comfortable, spacious and stable making them
  suitable for all ages and most abilities.    Whether it be for special family
  birthday, a reunion, family holiday or if you are a Gold Coast local wanting
  to show off our beautiful part of the world to visiting family members we
  invite you to enjoy a private yacht charter during the day or at sunset and
  create some new family memories to treasure for years to come.

  Our luxury catamarans are so family friendly.  The wide and spacious deck
  areas makes them ideal for everyone to get around and enjoy some fresh ocean
  air.   We like to encourage our guests (big or small) to have fun and
  participate in hoisting the sails and manning the helm (if they are keen)!


  Keep your eyes peeled throughout the cruise as you very well may spot some of
  the local wildlife on the picturesque Broadwater. Friendly and playful
  dolphins, soaring sea-eagles and wallabies on the shoreline are often to be
  seen while underway.   We can arrange rods and bait for you and the kids to
  have a go at catching a fish if you wish, simply let us know when booking.  


  For daytime cruises, the whole family will enjoy a stop at Wave Break Island,
  where our vessel's unique beach landing capabilities come into their own!    
  With a secret ladder on the foredeck it's easy to hop on and off for a swim or
  some serious sandcastle building!    There’s buckets and spades for the little
  ones to play and plenty of calm water for everyone to jump in for a swim or
  wade about in the shallows.   We also have SUPing and inflatable toys for the
  family to enjoy.   If you’re feeling energetic and want to bring the family
  together you can have a game of beach volleyball or cricket right there on the
  island, we have all the gear on board!


  We make chartering a boat easy and tailored to your family’s needs, so we give
  you the option of choosing where you would like to go and what you would like
  to do within your chartered time. We can offer adventure and family friendly
  activities or rest and relaxation, the choice is yours! You can choose to BYO
  food and drinks or a fully catered charter for easy planning. We supply the
  eskies, ice, BBQ and BBQ tools free of charge.

      title: What to Bring

        We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater.
        Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do and how long
        your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our
        team. In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim
        stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island
        activities on board. Your skipper can make recommendations on the day,
        if you don't wish to swim you could also go up and sail around the
        millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.


        In the evening we usually recommend sailing north to watch the sunset
        and returning to the southern part of the Broadwater to see the city
        lights after dark which are just beautiful.

      title: What's included?
    - dropdownContent: >-
        **Where do your boats depart from?**


        Our boats are berthed at D9 and D10 at Marina Mirage. Please see the
        'contact us' page on our website www.sailinginparadise.com.au for
        further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers
        and 15 mins from Broadbeach.


        **Where can I park?**


        There is plentiful free parking underneath the Marina Mirage Shopping
        Centre which you are permitted to use.


        **What about other transport options?**


        There are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost
        effective/convenient) if often via Maxi Taxis.


        **Are your charters suitable for children?**


        Absolutely!   We love having kids on board and our crew will often try
        and include them in the sailing and driving the boat.  We also carry a
        range of beach games suitable for kids including buckets and spades for
        the littlest family members.  The wide and spacious deck area also make
        the boats wonderful for kids.  Of course as any parent knows, you are
        always careful with children when it comes to being on the water, but as
        boats go our catamarans would be some of the most family friendly
        around.  Please feel free to contact our team if you have any questions
        about which boat may be best for your family.  


        **Are your charters suitable for guests with limited mobility?**


        We have welcomed several guests on board with limited mobility.  However
        we do realise that each individual is different in terms of ability and
        what they are comfortable with.  Please take a look at the 360 tours on
        the ['Our Boats'](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/) page for
        an ideal of getting around the boats and do bear in mind a big step up
        (or carry) is required to board the boats at the marina.  Our friendly
        team will be happy to discuss further to ensure you and your guests are
        comfortable prior to making a booking.  


        **Can I BYO food and drink?**


        Yes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is
        completely fine.


        **I am short on time can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**


        Yes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your convenience.
        Please request our full catering list as advance bookings are required.
        We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and
        private chefs.


        **Do you have Eskies on board?**


        Yes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be
        used for food or drink.


        **Will I get seasick?**


        Nope. We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast
        Broadwater. We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not
        experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have
        the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull
        vessels so you won't get seasick :-).


        **What happens if it rains?**


        First of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time on our
        boats especially in the warm Gold Coast endless summer... But do rest
        assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you
        to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or
        storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise.
        Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full
        details or contact our team.

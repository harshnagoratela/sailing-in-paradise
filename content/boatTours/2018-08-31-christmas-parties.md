  We have looked after all sorts of industry clients from fitness studios and uber-cool restaurants to banks and legal firms (and everything in between).

  ## The Christmas Party Boats


  What do our customers love about our catamarans?   Well, time and time again they tell us they are the ideal venue for parties!    And work Christmas Parties are no exception.

        Our 2 luxurious 10.5 metre resort style sailing catamarans mean we can
        now cater for larger groups of up to 50 people – The Spirit Of Gwonda
        can accommodate up to 30 guests (plus 2 crew) and our new boat the
        1000XL has a capacity of 20 (plus 2 crew).


        We can also arrange additional vessels for groups of up to 90 guests.
      title: 1-90 Guest Capacity

        The layout of our boats are ideal for a Christmas party venue and make
        entertaining large groups a delight.   The spacious interior of the boat
        offers plentiful seating, a large central table, a permanent hard roof
        and 360 degree visibility (making it suitable for all weather
        conditions).


        On-board you will find a small marine BBQ, large eskys (ice supplied), Fusion Marine sound system with speakers inside and out, bluetooth connectivity and premium Spotify provided and marine toilet.


        The front of the boat is extremely popular with guests, offering a trampoline-style area perfect for lazing in the sun whilst listening to the sounds of your favourite Christmas songs streaming through our Fusion sound system.

        The front boarding ladder and shallow draft make the vessel perfect for
        pulling up onto a beach at Wavebreak Island, South Stradbroke Island or
        one of the many golden sandy shores in the Gold Coast broadwater. Your
        skipper will pick the best spot for you on the day!


        Fancy floating around on an inflatable flamingo, or maybe giving Stand Up Paddle Boarding a go?   Perhaps you are feeling energetic and want to bring the team together with a hit of beach cricket or volleyball.   We carry all of these activities on-board for your use free of charge.

        If your boss got sick once on a Caribbean Cruise, or Carol from accounts
        feels a bit queasy whenever she gets in the bath, please tell them not
        to worry.    Why?  A few reasons;


        1. We sail in calm protected waters (we do not go offshore)

        2. We operate a wide, stable catamaran (not the same side to side rocking of single hull vessels) meaning you won’t spill a drop of your Christmas cocktail and you won’t be feeling queasy.

        3. You will be having too much fun!


        PS...  Carol should probably see a doctor, this is not normal :-)
      title: Smooth and Stable Catamarans = No sea-sickness guaranteed

        We work with some excellent caterers and can offer a range of Christmas,
        brunch, lunch or dinner options from budget through to premium.   If you
        would prefer to BYO that is completely fine too!


        We offer a full bar service including competitively priced drinks packages.  Alternatively you can choose to BYO drinks.
      title: Fully Catered and licensed or BYO
    - dropdownContent: "**Where do your boats depart from?**\r


        Our boats are berthed at D9 and D10 at Marina Mirage. Please see
        the 'contact us' page on our website for further details and a map.
        Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins from
        Broadbeach.\r


        \r


        **Where can I park?**\r


        There is plentiful free parking underneath the Marina Mirage
        Shopping Centre which you are permitted to use.\r


        \r


        **What about other transport options?**\r


        There are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and
        cost effective/convenient) if often via Maxi Taxis.\r  We can also help
        to arrange bus transfers for larger groups. \ 




        \r**Can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**\r


        Yes, we offer catering and drinks service for your convenience.
        Please request our full catering list as advance bookings are required.
        We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and
        private chefs.\r


        ****


        **Can I BYO food and drink?**\r


        Yes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board
        that is completely fine.\r


        \r


        **Do you have Eskies on board?**\r


        Yes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and
        can be used for food or drink.\r


        \r


        **Where can we go on our charter?**\r


        We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast
        Broadwater. Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do
        and how long your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss
        this with our team. In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests
        usually love a swim stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the
        range of island activities on board. Your skipper can make
        recommendations on the day, if you don't wish to swim you could also go
        up and sail around the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.\r


        In the evening we usually recommend sailing north to watch the
        sunset and returning to the southern part of the Broadwater to see the
        city lights after dark which are just beautiful.\r


        \r


        **Will I get seasick?**\r


        Nope. We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast
        Broadwater. We do not go\r offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not
        experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have
        the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull
        vessels so you won't get seasick :-).\r


        \r


        **What happens if it rains?**\r


        \r


        First of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time
        on our boats especially in the warm Gold Coast endless summer... But do
        rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want
        you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain
        or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your
        cruise. Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice
        for full details or contact our team."

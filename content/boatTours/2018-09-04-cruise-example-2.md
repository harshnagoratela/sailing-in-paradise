  Visit an isolated island beach only accessible by boat where you are invited
  to jump in for a swim and try our beach games (including Beach Volleyball,
  Stand Up Paddle-boarding, Beach Cricket, Snorkelling and Fun Novelty
  Inflatables).   Or if you just want to laze on the beach (or our
  trampoline-style foredeck) that's totally fine, we'll play some cool tunes and
  serve up an icy cold drink from our on-board bar so you can relax and watch
  the world sail by in style.     But don't forget to keep your eyes peeled for
  the friendly bottlenose dolphins who regularly cruise past.

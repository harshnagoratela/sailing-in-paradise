intro: >-
  A scattering of ashes at sea is often chosen by families whose dearly departed
  had a love of the water or boating.  As we too share this love, we will do
  everything within our power to make the experience memorable for all guests
  who attend a memorial service on board our vessels.   We often find that this
  time spent on board the boat brings the family together in a special way to
  celebrate the life of their lost loved one.  There is something about being
  out on the water, surrounded by the beauty of nature that has a very profound
  meaning at this emotional time and we are honoured to be able to share this
  with the family.  


  If you wish to scatter the ashes of your loved one in the pristine waters of
  the Gold Coast Broadwater we are able to offer a memorial charter aboard one
  of our comfortable sailing catamarans for groups from 1 â€“ 30 guests.

  Our vessels offer the ideal platform for safely dispersing the ashes from the
  rear boarding steps (which sit very close to water level whilst remaining safe
  and stable).   Our warm and respectful crew will sail the vessel to your
  preferred location (often the Seaway or nearby a favourite Island) before
  dropping anchor and recording the GPS coordinates of the location carefully. 


  The spacious and wide vessels are intimate in design though spacious enough to
  be suitable for families and groups.  We sail in the calm protected waters of
  the Gold Coast Broadwater meaning a comfortable sailing experience for all on
  board.  We can assist with catering and beverages or you are also most welcome
  to BYO food and drinks on board.   


  Please feel free to contact us before or after the cremation or funeral to
  discuss a private charter for spreading the ashes of your loved one.

        Our friendly and courteous crew will be on hand to welcome you at the
        boat and assist with boarding of your guests.   After a short safety
        briefing we will sail north in the calm, protected waters of the Gold
        Coast Broadwater.   


        Your preferred location for scattering the ashes can be discussed with
        our booking team in advance or decided on the day if you prefer.    Once
        we arrive at this location our crew will drop anchor in preparation for
        the scattering.   We have the facilities on board to play a favourite
        song and an area to displays photos or keepsakes during the cruise.  
        The rear steps to the waters edge offer an easily accessed and stable
        platform for scattering the ashes close to the water.


        Our crew will record the GPS coordination of the location.


        It is entirely up to you how you wish to spend the time on board the
        boat, many families bring along food and drink to enjoy and make the
        most of this opportunity to spend time together.  Some groups have even
        chosen to stop at an Island for a quick swim on the way back to the
        marina.    Please feel free to discuss your preferences with our team
        when booking and we will be happy to assist and advise on this.
      title: What to expect
    - dropdownContent: "**How does the dispersal of ashes actually work?**\n\nPlease feel free to discuss when making your booking if you have a special location in mind for the scattering of ashes and we will ensure our crew are fully briefed.  On the day the crew will drop anchor at this location and guide you to the rear steps which offer a safe and stable platform for you to get down close to the water and scatter the ashes.  It is also possible to purchase bio-degradable urns which float gently away before submerging into the water.    Many guests also choose to place a floral tribute into the point at this time.\n\n**Do you serve food and drink on board the boat?**\n\nWe can absolutely assist with catering and drinks, please ask for our catering and beverage menu.  We also welcome BYO should you prefer to arrange this.\n\n\n\n**What time can we arrive at the boat?**\r\n\nBoarding time is around 10-15 mins before departure which allows time for a short safety briefing before departure.  \n\n\n\n**Can we play a favourite song?**\r\n\nYes.   We have a sound system with speakers inside and out.   There is a device on board for you use with Premium Spotify so you can stream whatever you wish to play if available on Spotify.  You can also bluetooth your own device.  \n\n\n\n**What happens if the weather is not ok?**\n\n We have a very generous policy around weather allowing you to cancel or reschedule your charter in the event of torrential rain or storms.    If it is just a light forecast shower please do not worry as there are undercover areas on board the boat.\n\n\n\n**Will we get sea-sick?**\r\n\nWe operate in the  calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater.  We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves.   We sail catamarans which are very stable, they do not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels.   We have never had a sea sick guest on board.\n\n\n\n**Are the boats safe for elderly and very young guests?**\n\nOur boats are some of the safest and easiest to get around on the water.  With large open plan deck spaces and smooth, stable sailing.    We have welcomed guests of all ages on board.  If you do have any particular concerns though please let us know and we would be happy to discuss."

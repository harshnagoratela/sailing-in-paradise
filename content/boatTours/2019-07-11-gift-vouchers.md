intro: "Give the gift of a beautiful memory!   Your guests will be invited to join us for a beautiful 2 hour sunset and city lights cruise on the calm waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater.  \r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDeparting from Marina Mirage aboard a spacious sailing catamaran, the cruise includes a complimentary glass of bubbly to enjoy whilst watching the sun sink gracefully behind the mountains.    With no more than 30 guests on board this is an intimate cruise with a laid back and fun atmosphere.   \r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nThere is something very special about watching the sunset from the water and especially on the occasion we are joined by our friends the dolphins (who we are always looking out for by the way)!  The sparkling city lights of the Gold Coast look equally beautiful by night and are the perfect conclusion to your sail before returning to Marina Mirage."

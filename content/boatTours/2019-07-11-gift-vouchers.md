  Give the gift of a beautiful memory!   Your guests will be invited to join us
  for a beautiful 2 hour sunset and city lights cruise on the calm waters of the
  Gold Coast Broadwater.  


  Departing from Marina Mirage aboard a spacious sailing catamaran, the cruise
  includes a complimentary glass of bubbly to enjoy whilst watching the sun sink
  gracefully behind the mountains.    With no more than 30 guests on board this
  is an intimate cruise with a laid back and fun atmosphere.   


  There is something very special about watching the sunset from the water and
  especially on the occasion we are joined by our friends the dolphins (who we
  are always looking out for by the way)!  The sparkling city lights of the Gold
  Coast look equally beautiful by night and are the perfect conclusion to your
  sail before returning to Marina Mirage.

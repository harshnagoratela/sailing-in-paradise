contentColumn: >-
  From 21st birthdays all the way through to 80th's and beyond, we can create a
  memorable and fun birthday party that you and your guests will remember for
  years to come.


  We can cater for groups of up to 30 people on our signature sailing catamaran the 'Spirit of Gwonda', or up to 20 on our Seawind 1000XL.  If you have a larger group be sure to check out our amazing [Raft-Up Party](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/boat-charter/raft-up-parties/) options.  


  The smooth and stable nature of the catamaran means our boats are suitable for all ages and abilities.   [Take a tour of our boats](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/).


  No matter what style of birthday party you wish to create, we can help. Whether you are looking for a relaxing day on the water with a BBQ and a few beers, a kids birthday party with a beach stopover, sand castles, cakes and clowns, or a boat party with cocktails, inflatable flamingos and awesome tunes... bring it on!   


  Our guests tell us that spending a day (or evening) on the water was one of their best ever birthday party ideas!

   At Sailing In Paradise, we are continually striving to create the best experience possible for our guests.  We understand that you want your special day to be memorable, fun, relaxing and stress free and that is exactly where we come in...

  From the moment you send through an enquiry, all the way through to the follow up email with your free souvenir photos after your cruise, we pride ourselves on our professional yet friendly and laid-back attitude.

        When you book a private charter with Sailing in Paradise you can expect
        a quality of service from years of experience in the industry but most
        of all your can expect a fun day (or evening) on the water that your
        group will love.  Every day is different when you have your Gold Coast
        birthday party on board Sailing In Paradise but one thing is for sure...
        you're in for one hell of a good time.


        Some things we love include:


        Sailing, beach stopovers, inflatables, stand up paddleboards, snorkeling, sunbathing, sunsets and dolphins.   All included free of charge*.


        Some things are almost mandatory:


        Singing Happy Birthday to you, cake, embarassing speeches, presents, cake, all your favourite songs...did we mention cake?


        \*As much as we have tried to bribe the dolphins to turn up every cruise we can't guarantee they will...fish to chase, waves to jump, fun to be had etc... but it sure is a beautiful sight when they do join us.
      title: What to expect
    - dropdownContent: |-
        Keep it simple;

        * Swimmers and beach towels.
        * Food and drink (unless you want us to organise the catering for you).
        * Smiles and good vibes.
        * A few decorations or special photos to pop on the table if you wish.

        We'll provide the rest.
      title: What to Bring
    - dropdownContent: >-
        We love a good birthday but to keep our boats safe and nicely presented
        there are a few things we do not allow on board;


        * Red wine

        * Sparklers

        * Decorations that stain/leak ink when wet

        * Drunken idiots (tipsy fun peeps totally fine)

        * Budgie Smugglers and mankinis :-)    Well if you are the birthday boy and desperately want to wear one we might bend the rules for you just once...
      title: Considerations
    - dropdownContent: >-
        We have done a lot of research to find the best Gold Coast party
        caterers and are happy to organise this on your behalf, or you are more
        than welcome to BYO.


        We do have a bbq on board which you are welcome to use however we recommend this only if you have booked the boat for 4 hours or more as it can take quite a while for you to cook a BBQ and you need to leave time for relaxation too right?


        Grazing style boards and platters are ideal 'boat food'. These can look sensational as a centrepiece for the large timber tables we have on board and your guests are free to pick away at their convenience.


        We offer Grazing Boards, Tapas , BBQs, Canapes and Private Chefs plus many more catering options.  


        We can also assist with a drinks service and offer pre-paid tabs, drinks packages or paid bar options.   If you prefer to BYO your drinks this is also possible.


        Please enquire and you will receive a list of catering and beverage options.
      title: Catered or BYO
    - dropdownContent: >-
        Arrive in style with a stretch Hummer or limousine transfer to the
        marina.


        Add some exciting watersports to your charter. Jetboating and Parasailing can be arranged and they can pick you up off the boat for a true VIP Experience.

        Q. What happens if it's raining?


        A. First of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great party on our boats ha ha... But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise. Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team.


        Q. I sometimes get seasick, are there waves?


        A. The boat is very smooth and stable and we operate in the calm Broadwater so there are not many waves apart from the odd boat wash. Our skilled captains have ways of keeping the boat very smooth so you don't spill your drink and you definitely won't get seasick.


        Q. Do I need to bring sunscreen, inflatables, towels, camera, water or music?


        A. Most things are provided however you will need to byo towel ad camera. One of our friendly staff can let you know what is included when you make your initial enquiry.


        Q. How do I book?


        A. Fill out an enquiry form and you will quickly get all the info you need including availability, pricing, inclusions etc. Then it is simply a matter of paying your deposit to secure your preferred date. But don't dawdle as we quickly book out and we don't want you to be disappointed.


        Q. Why should we choose you over another operator?


        A. This list is endless. Check out our reviews, check out our socials, speak to someone who has been with us before (you would be surprised, you will probably know someone who has been with us?), and we pride ourselves on the fact that our guests keep coming back (some have sailed with us as many as 8 times). We go out of our way to create the best experience possible and are constantly updating, re-inventing, reinvesting and reviewing. We're not happy until you're happy and we want you to come back again and again.  We can blow our own trumpet from time to time right?  :-)

contentColumn: >-
  Step aboard your own private catamaran, and the beautiful Gold Coast
  Broadwater becomes your playground.   During the day you will enjoy
  spectacular views and access to pristine beaches as the boat arrives at
  isolated islands surrounded by crystal clear turquoise waters.   There are
  plentiful activities available on board to keep you entertained including
  Beach Volleyball, Stand Up Paddleboards, Inflatables, Beach Cricket and
  Snorkel gear.  


  Sail at sunset and you will be treated to a sunset across the Broadwater and over the Gold Coast Mountains followed by the twinkling Gold Coast City Skyline by night, simply breathtaking!


  We offer a range of catering and beverage options and also welcome BYO.  


  Whatever the occasion, cruising the Gold Coast Broadwater with a Private Boat Charter aboard your own luxury catamaran is a great way to spend a day or evening and Sailing in Paradise is the ultimate venue for your next event.

        recommendations on the day, if you don't wish to swim you could also go
        up and sail around the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.\r

      title: What's included?
    - dropdownContent: "**Where do your boats depart from?**\r


        Our boats are berthed at D9 and D10 at Marina Mirage. Please see
        the 'contact us' page on our website www.sailinginparadise.com.au for
        further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers
        and 15 mins from Broadbeach.\r


        \r


        **Where can I park?**\r


        There is plentiful free parking underneath the Marina Mirage
        Shopping Centre which you are permitted to use.\r


        \r****


        **What about other transport options?**\r


        There are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and
        cost effective/convenient) if often via Maxi Taxis.\r


        \r


        **Are your charters suitable for children?**\r


        Absolutely! We love having kids on board and our crew will often
        try and include them in the sailing and driving the boat. We also carry
        a range of beach games suitable for kids including buckets and spades
        for the littlest family members. The wide and spacious deck area also
        make the boats wonderful for kids, of course you are always careful with
        children when it comes to being on the water but as boats go our
        catamarans would be some of the most family friendly around. Please feel
        free to contact our team if you have any questions about which boat may
        be best for your family.\r


        \r


        **Can I BYO food and drink?**\r


        Yes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board
        that is completely fine.\r


        \r


        **I am short on time can you please help me out with
        catering/drinks?**\r


        Yes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your
        convenience. Please request our full catering list as advance bookings
        are required. We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards,
        to tapas and private chefs.\r


        \r


        **Do you have Eskies on board?**\r


        Yes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and
        can be used for food or drink.\r


        \r


        **Will I get seasick?**\r


        Nope. We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast
        Broadwater. We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not
        experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have
        the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull
        vessels so you won't get seasick :-).\r


        \r


        **What happens if it rains?**\r


        First of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time
        on our boats especially in the warm Gold Coast endless summer... But do
        rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want
        you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain
        or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your
        cruise. Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice
        for full details or contact our team."

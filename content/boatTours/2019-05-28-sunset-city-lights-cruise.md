  ## Gold Coast Sunset Cruise


  Looking for the Gold Coast's best sunset views?   There is no better place to
  watch the sunset on the Gold Coast than, relaxing on a yacht on the
  Broadwater!   No seriously...


  There is something so magical about a sunset over the water.  But surrounded
  by it?  Well that's something else...    


  So come and join us on our sunset cruise as the sun sinks behind the mountains
  of the Gold Coast Hinterland and casts a glow across the calm waters of the
  Gold Coast Broadwater.    


  We've got the champagne on ice!

  Join us for a cruise of the Gold Coast Broadwater aboard our beautiful Seawind
  1050 Sailing Catamaran. With no more than 30 guests on board, this sunset
  cruise is laid back, relaxed and fun. The skipper will drop in some local
  knowledge for those who are interested. Guests can relax on the foredeck,
  inside the main cabin, or on a comfy bean bag to the sounds of some very cool
  tunes and enjoy a few drinks. We curate an intimate cruise experience with a
  social atmosphere. Our vessel ‘Spirit of Gwonda’ is often joined by wild
  bottle-nose dolphins as they come in search of their evening meal and being
  nice and close to the water gets you nice and close to the dolphins if they
  decide to join your cruise. You will enjoy one complimentary glass of
  sparkling wine, beer or soft drink and nibbles and further drinks can be
  purchased on board at only $5 per drink.

  ## Gold Coast Sunset Cruise


  **Our ticketed sunset cruises are currently not operational due to social distancing requirements.  We are still offering private sunset charters which are suitable for groups from 2 to 30 guests.**  


  **Please click the 'boat charter' tab in the main menu to view the most appropriate private charter option or send through an enquiry via the tab below.**  


  Looking for the Gold Coast's best sunset views?   There is no better place to watch the sunset on the Gold Coast than relaxing on a yacht on the Broadwater!   No seriously...


  There is something so magical about a sunset over the water.  But surrounded by it?  Well that's something else...    


  So come and join us on our sunset cruise as the sun sinks behind the mountains of the Gold Coast Hinterland and casts a glow across the calm waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater.

contentColumn: Join us for a cruise of the Gold Coast Broadwater aboard our
  beautiful Seawind 1050 Sailing Catamaran. With no more than 30 guests on
  board, this sunset cruise is laid back, relaxed and fun. The skipper will drop
  in some local knowledge for those who are interested. Guests can relax on the
  foredeck, inside the main cabin, or on a comfy bean bag to the sounds of some
  very cool tunes and enjoy a few drinks. We curate an intimate cruise
  experience with a social atmosphere. Our vessel ‘Spirit of Gwonda’ is often
  joined by wild bottle-nose dolphins as they come in search of their evening
  meal and being nice and close to the water gets you nice and close to the
  dolphins if they decide to join your cruise. You will enjoy one complimentary
  glass of sparkling wine, beer or soft drink and nibbles and further drinks can
  be purchased on board at only $5 per drink.

        * Whilst we welcome small groups on board our sunset cruise, group sizes are limited to maximum 10 guests.   We ask that groups respect the fact that this is a shared cruise with a relaxed laid-back vibe.   Groups over 10 in size, celebrating a special occasion, or those who prefer to curate a more party vibe would benefit from enquiring about a private charter which can often be just as affordable for larger groups.

Guests are able to reschedule or request a refund in this circumstance.

        * Cruises require minimum numbers to depart. In the event of minimum numbers not being met guests will be offered a full refund or the opportunity to reschedule to an alternative date.

  ## Celebrate your Staff Christmas Party in style!


  Looking for somewhere unique to host this year’s work Christmas Party?  How
  does a Boat Cruise aboard your own private catamaran sound?    It's the staff
  Christmas Party everyone will be talking about for years to come.   You’ll be
  sailing in the beautiful Gold Coast sunshine surrounded by crystal blue
  waters, isolated islands and golden beaches, sipping on icy cold drinks and
  enjoying delicious food.  We challenge you to find another office Christmas
  Party venue with views to match where you can BYO, play your own tunes and
  float around on an inflatable flamingo, cocktail in hand...


  Sounds awesome right?   


  Sailing in Paradise would love to create a work Christmas Party that you and
  your team will remember forever!     So please fill out our enquiry form, send
  us an email or give us a bell.  We are a friendly, professional crew and we’d
  love the chance to chat with you.

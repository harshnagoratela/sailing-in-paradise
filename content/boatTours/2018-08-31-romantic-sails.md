  Choose from our daytime or evening sailing options to experience the Gold
  Coast in a different light.  During the day, our boats are equipped for beach
  landings so you may wish to stop at an Island for swimming, SUP'ing and
  snorkelling.  As dusk falls, the sunset over the Gold Coast hinterland
  mountains is a delight to view from the water, and after dark the Surfers
  Paradise Skyline puts on a stunning light show for our return to Marina
  Mirage.  


  Our beautiful Seawind 1000XL is the ideal vessel for couples due to its
  intimate design, and offers the relaxation of sailing in complete comfort.  
  The trampoline-style foredeck is a favourite spot for snuggling and gives an
  immersive sailing experience with 360 degree views of the Gold Coastâ€™s
  stunning waterways.  It is also the ideal spot for spying the friendly
  bottle-nose dolphins who frequently ride the bow waves of our catamarans, so
  close you can almost touch...

  your charter which can be fully customised to your wishes.

    - dropdownContent: "We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do and how long your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our team. In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island activities on board. Your skipper can make recommendations on the day, if you don't wish to swim you could also go up and sail around the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands in this time.\r  With a longer charter you may also have time for a snorkel stop or to visit South Stradbroke Island or spend a little longer chilling at Wavebreak and enjoy a relaxing lunch.  \n\nIn the evening we usually recommend sailing north to watch the sunset and returning to the southern part of the Broadwater to see the city lights after dark which are just beautiful."

      title: Do you offer special packages?
    - dropdownContent: >-
        **Where do your boats depart from?**


        Our boats are berthed at D9 and D10 at Marina Mirage. Please see the
        'contact us' page on our website www.sailinginparadise.com.au for
        further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers
        and 15 mins from Broadbeach.


        **Where can I park?**


        There is plentiful free parking underneath the Marina Mirage Shopping
        Centre which you are permitted to use.


        **What about other transport options?**


        There are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost
        effective/convenient) if often via Taxi or Uber.


        **Can I BYO food and drink?**


        Yes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is
        completely fine.


        **I am short on time can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**


        Yes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your convenience.
        Please request our full catering list as advance bookings are required.
        We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and
        private chefs.


        **Do you have Eskies on board?**


        Yes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be
        used for food or drink.


        **Will I get seasick?**


        Nope. We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast
        Broadwater. We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not
        experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have
        the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull
        vessels so you won't get seasick :-).


        **What happens if it rains?**


        First of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time on our
        boats especially in the warm Gold Coast endless summer... But do rest
        assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you
        to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or
        storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise.
        Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full
        details or contact our team.

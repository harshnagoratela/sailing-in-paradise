  What  a wonderful  experience! I certainly cannot fault them at all. The staff
  were exceptional and the boat was even better than I had expected. I would
  highly recommend!

Amy organised her friends hen's party with us, it was a day full of smiles and blue skies. We set up SUP's and inflatables for her guests to enjoy while we were pulled up on the sand at the secluded Wave Break Island. Check out the photos to see how crystal clear the water is there!

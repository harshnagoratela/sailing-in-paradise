  “Wow - what a day for 10 adults & 6 children aged 6 - 12! We are locals and
  are thrilled to know this fantastic experience lived up to all our
  expectations - & more! You can believe all the reviews - they are spot on!
  Steve & Jess delivered on everything we asked of them and Tony & Chanelle were
  a delight to have on board with us - always there to help - chose the perfect
  location for swimming, took some amazing photos & let the kids take over
  Spotify! We requested an additional hour - 9am-1pm - perfect timing to take in
  the Broadwater, have a swim & enjoy Brunch! I'm sure it won’t be our last
  venture on Sailing in Paradise.” TripAdvisor

If you live on the Gold Coast like Robyn, you know we live in paradise! To celebrate a special birthday, we took Robyn and her family to one of the Gold Coast's best hidden gems, Wave Break Island. The additional hour allowed for the BBQ brunch to be cooked at their leisure while the kids were too busy playing on the shore! Time flies when you’re having fun!

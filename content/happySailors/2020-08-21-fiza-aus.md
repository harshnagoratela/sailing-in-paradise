excerpt: "Went sailing with a group of friends for a Hen's celebration in Gold
  Coast, absolutely loved EVERY SINGLE THING about this experience! The helpful
  and friendly crew was just fabulous to have with us! The availability of
  amenities on the cruise was good, and the snacks, photography, beach
  games/inflatables and music made it all even better! Would definitely
  recommend and also do it again "

Hen’s parties are our speciality! They are a special time for the “bride to be” to celebrate with her friends. We took Fiza and her group out for a sail to the beautiful Wave Break Island for some quality time with her friends. Think "island fun", beach games and lounging out on the front deck without a care in the world! Hard to beat!

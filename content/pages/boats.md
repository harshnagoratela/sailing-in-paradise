      Our signature vessel, the ‘Spirit Of Gwonda’ is a Seawind 1050 Resort
      sailing catamaran which has been purpose built for entertaining and day
      cruises.    With no need for bedrooms this allows for extra deck space to
      accommodate up to 30 guests.


      The clever and unique design of this vessel offers a completely open plan
      layout so your guests can interact with each other at all times.


      Of course we still offer all the luxuries you would expect including the
      ever-popular front trampoline sections for soaking up the sun, comfortable
      inside seating around a large central table, barbecue and modern bathroom
      facilities.


      Measuring 10.5m long by 6.5m wide, there is ample space for up to 30
      people (plus 2 crew), approx 60 square metres of deck space in fact.  You
      will be amazed at the room available inside this smooth and stable boat,
      making it ideal for social occasions of all kinds. The Spirit Of Gwonda is
      truly unique and the only one of it’s kind on the Gold Coast.

      The latest addition to our fleet is a Seawind 1000XL. These catamarans are
      extremely popular in bareboat charter fleets as they have a great layout
      and all the extras you would expect from an overnight equipped vessel.


      The interior is set out with upholstered booth style seating around a
      dining table with windows allowing for 360 degree viewing from all areas.
      There is extra seating in the targa area at the back, and, as with our
      other vessel, there is ample area to laze around in the sun on the front
      trampoline area.


      The 1000XL is also equipped with large esky, a marine bbq, and a modern
      bathroom with the added bonus of hot and cold showers both above and below
      deck.


      The 1000XL is perfect for groups of up to 20 people (plus 2 crew).

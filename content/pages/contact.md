### FIND US AT MARINA MIRAGE

We are conveniently located at Marina Mirage, 74 Seaworld Drive, Main Beach.    There is plentiful free parking which you are invited to use alongside and beneath the Marina Mirage Shopping Centre.

### HOW TO FIND THE BOAT AT THE MARINA

When you reach Marina Mirage you will need to find the boat!!    The access to our wharf is located near the Ray White Marine Office.  **Please enter through the BLACK GATES (you will see our sign here on your left) and follow the walkway down to the floating wharf. This is the D Arm of Marina Mirage (you will also see a map of the marina on your left before entering these gates).**

Please **DO NOT** go down the pier with the big yellow arches as that is Mariners Cove and you will not be able to access the boat easily from this side.

If you can’t find us you can always call us and we will be happy to guide you.

### FIND US AT MARINA MIRAGE

We are conveniently located at Marina Mirage, 74 Seaworld Drive, Main Beach. There is plentiful free parking which you are invited to use alongside and beneath the Marina Mirage Shopping Centre.

### HOW TO FIND THE BOAT AT THE MARINA

Marina Mirage are currently undergoing works on the commercial arm of their marina.  As such our vessels are being occasionally relocated within the marina.  We recommend checking back prior to your charter to confirm current vessel location (please disregard the adjacent map on this page).

At present you will find our vessels located adjacent to the gold Coast Ferry Terminal.  The location is indicated by a blue star on the aerial photo below.

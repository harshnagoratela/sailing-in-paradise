    We have 2 of the most beautiful and well maintained sailing catamarans
    available.


    These yachts are smooth and stable and  perfect for entertaining.


    Imagine yourself lazing in the sun on the trampoline style foredeck with a cocktail in hand or relaxing with friends in the undercover area, either way you will enjoy unobstructed views of the beautiful Gold Coast Broadwater and surrounds.


    Everything is taken care of when you charter one of our boats - the coolest tunes playing through state of the art sound system with speakers inside and out, large eskies stocked with ice, large central timber table for presenting your food, marine barbecue, inflatables, paddleboards and beach games, clean modern bathroom facilities, the list goes on.


    And our crew are on hand to ensure that your event is the best it can be.


    From your initial enquiry all the way through to your special day and beyond, we go out of our way to ensure your expectations are not only met but exceeded.


    We know organising an event can sometimes be stressful, but Sailing In Paradise's Guest Relations Gurus will take away the stress and replace it with fun.


    On the day you will be greeted with smiles.. and good times will follow.

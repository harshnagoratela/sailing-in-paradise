First and foremost our main priority as a business is to follow government guidelines and keep people safe including our most vulnerable.    We have made the decision to continue operating at this time and will be reviewing this daily as new information comes to hand.

Thankfully we are lucky enough to work in the beautiful Queensland sunshine and ocean waters (rather than in a confined indoor space) but nevertheless we have put some additional steps in place to ensure a safe and sanitary environment at this time;

* We will be re-scheduling some bookings slightly to allow extra time for cleaning and sanitization between charters. 
* We have added extra cleaning routines and disinfecting on board the vessels, particularly around high touch points on the boat. 
* We have hand sanitiser available for guests/crew on board the boat.   
* We have cancelled our ticketed tourist cruises at this time, with boats only available for private charters (generally local guests).
* Although we usually encourage friendly greetings and fun we have asked our crew (in line with government guidelines) to practice some social distancing at this point and refrain from hugging, hand shakes etc between guests and crew.
* We are respectfully requesting that guests who are unwell or have travelled or been exposed to COVID-19 in the last 14 days do not board the vessel. We politely request that you advise us of any recent overseas travel, illness, or contact with people diagnosed with COVID-19.  
* We require that our crew follow all government guidelines and advise us ASAP if symptomatic or have been in contact with a COVID-19 case. None of our crew have travelled overseas recently. 
* We are working with our caterers to implement measures to avoid food contamination.
* We are encouraging our guests who are BYO food and drinks to follow a few simple measures to avoid food and drink sharing.  
* In the current health situation we are altering the usual cancellation policy and allowing guests unable to attend due to COVID-19 illness/government restrictions etc to reschedule their cruise for a new date within 18 months of their original charter date with no penalty*.    We ask that guests contact us directly to discuss individual circumstances as we are happy to work together to come to a solution.  

The Sailing in Paradise family have chosen to remain positive at this time and we honestly feel that this is something we can get through together as a community.    Stay strong, keep giving off the good vibes, support local business...and get some sunshine!! :-)   

We appreciate your custom and look forward to welcoming you on board.

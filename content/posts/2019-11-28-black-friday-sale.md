  Cruises can be booked online using the voucher codes provided at time of
  purchase.  Sunset Cruises are subject to availability and a calendar will be
  published on the Sailing in Paradise website which is updated regularly.  
  Please note that whilst we welcome small groups on board our sunset cruise,
  for the enjoyment of other guests on board we do limit group sizes to 10.  We
  ask that groups respect the fact that this is a shared sailing experience and
  there are often couples on board seeking a more relaxed experience too.   We
  curate a social environment, however for larger groups and those celebrating a
  special event you may find that a private charter is a better (and often just
  as affordable) option which will be more enjoyable for your group.   All other
  terms and conditions of the sunset cruise product apply.
